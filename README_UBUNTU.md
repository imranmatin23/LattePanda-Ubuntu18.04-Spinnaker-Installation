Press *Select image* and locate the Ubuntu .iso that you downloaded in Step 1. Press *Select target* and locate the USB drive that you have inserted (It may be /dev/disk2, but confirm the size of the disk matches to make sure). Then select *Flash*.

    *  NOTE: If the USB does not show up when you select *Select Target*, you must erase and reformat the USB to FAT32 first. Once this is done, repeat Step 4.

    * NOTE: Once BalenaEtcher finishes with USB, an error about the USB may come up saying *"The disk you inserted was not readable by this computer."* Go ahead and ignore it by pressing ignore.

5. Remove the USB from your local computer.

3. Plug in your HDMI cord.

4. Plug in your Ethernet cable. 

5. Plug in the microUSB power cord. When plugged in, you should see the red LED indicator light up on the underside of the board. This means that the LattePanda is initializing. Wait patiently for a few seconds until the LED light goes out.

6. When the LED indicator turns off, be ready to press ESC (READ Step 7). Then press the power button (top white button farther from the corner of the board) to turn on the LattePanda. You should see the LED indicator light up again.

    * NOTE: Your mouse may be jittery or leave multiple copies on the screen. Currently, there is no solution for this.

You will have to find out which edge will allow the mouse to disappear of the monitor. Then you must try to grab the installation window from the internal display and drag it onto the monitor. Think of a virtual screen that contains the installation window and you need that window on your monitor.

15. When the installation is complete popup displays, select *Restart Now*. Remove the USB after you have done this.

16. Please skip this step if the orange Ubuntu Desktop with the Beaver in the background is displayed.
    * If you did not select "login automatically", then either the current time on an orange background or a purple screen will appear. 
    * If the current time on an orange background appears, press the space bar once and that will bring up a purple screen. 
    * When the purple screen is displayed, you need to enter your password even though it may not show the prompt. Once the password is entered, the Desktop with an orange background and beaver will appear.
