# Running a Jupyter Notebook for a Remote Host on Local Host

This is guide on how to open a Jupyter Notebook on your local machine for a remote machine. It is adapted from this [tutorial](https://ljvmiranda921.github.io/notebook/2018/01/31/running-a-jupyter-notebook/) by Lj Miranda. Also thank you to Noopur R K for this (tutorial)[https://medium.com/@nrk25693/how-to-add-your-conda-environment-to-your-jupyter-notebook-in-just-4-steps-abeab8b8d084] about how to add your Conda environment to Jupyter Notebooks.

## Steps
1. Login into your remote machine using ssh.
`ssh [USER]@[IP_ADDRESS]`

2. To create Jupyter Notebooks in the Spinnaker environment, the below commands must be run.
```
conda install -c anaconda ipykernel
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=[ENV]
```

3. Run a Jupyter Notebook from your remote machine.
`jupyter notebook --no-browser --port=XXXX`

4. Forward port `XXXX` which is where your notebook is running on your remote machine, to `YYYY` which is where you want your local machine to listen for that port. 
`ssh -N -f -L localhost:YYYY:localhost:XXXX [USER}@[IP_ADDRESS]`

5. On your local machine, open up the remote Jupyter Notebook by typing this in your browser.
`localhost:YYYY`

6. Enter the token for your remote machine. This can be found in the remote machine's terminal where you opened your Jupyter Notebook. It is part of one of the available URLs to access the notebook.

7. Closing the connection can be done by entering `CTRL-C` and `Y` on your remote machine's terminal. Optional is to kill the process for that Jupyter Notebook on your local machine as well.

## Notes
- You can think of this as `remotehost -> XXXX` which is one part of the tunnel and then `YYYY -> localhost` as the other part of the tunnel. When you connect those parts together, there is a `jupyter tunnel` from your remotehost to your localhost.
